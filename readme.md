# ForecastJudge

Usually, weather data is retrieved by a central source like DWD, and its interpretation, as well as forecasting, is carried out by a variety of meteorologists. They produce a range of forecasts that can differ significantly from one another, even when predicting just a couple of hours into the future. Predicting the future in chaotic systems is obviously a challenging problem, but undoubtedly, some forecasts will be better than others. The idea of ForecastJudge is to collect nowcasts and forecasts over a period of time to compare reality to prediction. A goodness of fit, calculated for all sources, shall show the quality of the forecasts.
